# Telegram View Bot

## Description
This repository contains a Python-based Telegram view bot designed to automate the process of increasing view counts for Telegram posts. Using a rotating proxy system, asynchronous requests, and token fetching, this bot provides an efficient and scalable solution for increasing engagement metrics on Telegram.

---

## Features
- **Rotating Proxies:** Supports multiple proxies to distribute requests and avoid rate-limiting.
- **Customizable Settings:** Modify user-agent, number of views per post, timeout, and semaphore count via the `settings.json` file.
- **Asynchronous Execution:** Uses `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for concurrent requests, making the bot highly efficient.
- **Token Fetching:** Extracts view tokens directly from Telegram's embed URLs.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for failed requests and invalid proxies.
